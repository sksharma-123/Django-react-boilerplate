# Django-react Boilerplate

Hi guys... this is the basic django-react boilerplate code created by me to start with the combination of the best frontend framework `reactjs` and the best backend framework `django`.
#
**You have to worry about nothing....**
### Just clone this code or download it as zip file and open it.
Install the backend requirements using the command --

> ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Install the frontend dependencies using the command --
 
> ```npm install``` or ```npm i```

### Now you will require two terminals to run the server.
In the first terminal run the command --

> ```npm run dev```

And in the second terminal run the command --

> ```python manage.py runserver```
## All done....
## Just enjoy coding....
